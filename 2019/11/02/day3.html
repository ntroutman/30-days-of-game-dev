    <p>First thing, I’ve restarted my project. I have an idea for a top down game and I though doing the 30 Day challenge would be a good way to jump start it, but instead I kept getting distracted by the things I wanted to do with my idea, not really following the challenge, so instead I’m working on a redo using a first person project with a stealth component, which I got inspired to do after watching 
Matthew Palaje’s “<a href="https://youtu.be/H7PfkXX65Ng">Game A Month Indie Devlog #4 - Stealth Game Prototype</a>”. So I think I’m going to try making an FPS stealthy kind of game.</p>

<p>Doing the pickup wasn’t to bad. I picked a sword from Infinity blade that looked kind of sci-fi to use as a weapon. Created a new blueprint and slapped a Collision Sphere on it, and then when you interact with the object it mounts it to the characters socket. For this I first removed the existing gun so that you start out with nothing in your hands. It looks a little silly since your hand is just floating:</p>

<p>Then you pickup the weapon and can see it. Kind of cool, but the animations are all for having a gun, so it looks dorky:</p>

<p>Other than that though, it is a pick-up item!</p>
