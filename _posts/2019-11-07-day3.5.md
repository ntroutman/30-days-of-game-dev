After hacking in the collectible in Day 3 I felt like I should build a proper inventory system. So I went to YouTube and started watching a ton of tutorials. I particularly found the one by [Titanic Games](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdoWGpMQK_L29bWXoDeIItw) on making an [Inventory System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko8rfLJKcAE) really helpful.

I found it annoying that no one just posted the outlining material so I'm including my version [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ueassets/IteractableHighlight_M.uasset). It will also be in the GitHub repo.

After re-watching some videos a couple of times I managed to get an interaction system working with highlighting when you are pointing near the object.

*Interactable work by using a Sphere Collision to toggle them as potentially interactable.*
