Installing Unreal Engine. Futzed around trying to find if I already had an Epic account, apparently not. Created one and then launched UE4... and waited ... and waited .. and waited. This thing takes forever to start up on my laptop.

Selected a top-down view...it matches the game idea I have later on, so, might as well get used to it.

Found the `Volumes`, added a "Trigger Volume" then attached a Blueprint. From there it was easy to drag a new node from the event, type 'sound' and pick "Play 2D sound at location". Grab the actors location, pick a random sound, and done with Day 1.
